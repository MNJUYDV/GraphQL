# GraphQL Python Project

This is a simple example of a GraphQL server implemented in Python using the `graphene` library. It provides a basic GraphQL schema for querying authors and books.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-graphql-python-project.git

You can use the provided sample queries to interact with the GraphQL API. For example:

graphql
Copy code
{
    all_authors {
        id
        name
        books {
            title
        }
    }
}
